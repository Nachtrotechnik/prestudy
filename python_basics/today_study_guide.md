## ‚è∞ **Study Session Breakdown (2-3 hours total)**

### **Session 1: Environment Setup (30 minutes)**
**Time: 8:00 AM - 8:30 AM**

#### **What to do:**
1. **Verify Python installation** ‚úÖ (Already done - Python 3.13.7)
2. **Set up VS Code** (if not already done)
3. **Create your first project folder**
4. **Test your setup**

#### **Commands to run:**
```bash
# Create your Python project folder
mkdir ~/python_learning
cd ~/python_learning

# Create your first Python file
touch hello_world.py
```

---

### **Session 2: Your First Python Program (45 minutes)**
**Time: 8:30 AM - 9:15 AM**

#### **Exercise 1: Hello World Program**
Create `hello_world.py`:

```python
# This is your first Python program!
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python learning!")

# Variables and basic data types
name = "Student"
age = 25
is_learning = True

print(f"My name is {name}")
print(f"I am {age} years old")
print(f"Am I learning Python? {is_learning}")

# Check data types
print(f"Type of name: {type(name)}")
print(f"Type of age: {type(age)}")
print(f"Type of is_learning: {type(is_learning)}")
```

#### **Run your program:**
```bash
python3 hello_world.py
```

---

### **Session 3: Basic Syntax & Data Types (45 minutes)**
**Time: 9:15 AM - 10:00 AM**

#### **Exercise 2: Calculator Program**
Create `calculator.py`:

```python
# Simple calculator program
print("=== Simple Calculator ===")

# Get user input
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Perform calculations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2 if num2 != 0 else "Error: Division by zero"

# Display results
print(f"\nResults:")
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {addition}")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}")
print(f"{num1} √ó {num2} = {multiplication}")
print(f"{num1} √∑ {num2} = {division}")
```

---

### **Session 4: Control Flow & Loops (45 minutes)**
**Time: 10:00 AM - 10:45 AM**

#### **Exercise 3: Number Guessing Game**
Create `guessing_game.py`:

```python
import random

print("=== Number Guessing Game ===")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100")

# Generate random number
secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 10

while attempts < max_attempts:
    # Get user guess
    try:
        guess = int(input(f"\nEnter your guess (attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}): "))
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check guess
        if guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low! Try a higher number.")
        elif guess > secret_number:
            print("Too high! Try a lower number.")
        else:
            print(f"\nüéâ Congratulations! You guessed it in {attempts} attempts!")
            break
            
        # Show remaining attempts
        print(f"Attempts remaining: {max_attempts - attempts}")
        
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number!")
        continue

if attempts >= max_attempts:
    print(f"\nüòî Game Over! The number was {secret_number}")
```

## üìö **What You'll Learn Today**

### **Core Concepts:**
1. **Print statements** - Output to console
2. **Variables** - Storing data
3. **Data types** - int, float, str, bool
4. **User input** - Getting data from user
5. **Type conversion** - Converting between types
6. **Conditional statements** - if/else logic
7. **Loops** - while loops and control flow
8. **Error handling** - Basic try/except

### **Python Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments to explain your code
- Handle user input errors gracefully
- Use f-strings for formatted output

---

## üí° **Study Tips for Today**

1. **Code along**: Don't just read - type every line
2. **Experiment**: Change values and see what happens
3. **Break it**: Try to break your code and fix it
4. **Ask questions**: Note anything unclear for tomorrow
5. **Take breaks**: 5-minute break every 45 minutes
