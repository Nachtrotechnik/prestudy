## 📋 **Session Completion Protocol**

### **After Each Session (30+ minutes of study):**
1. **Update Progress Files:**
   - Mark completed topics with ✅ in `progress/week1_progress.md`
   - Update time spent and add session notes
   - Add reflection questions for completed topics
   - Update Meta exercise completion status

2. **Session Documentation:**
   - Record specific challenges faced and solutions
   - Note key learnings and breakthroughs
   - Document any debugging processes or errors resolved

---

## 📅 **Daily Schedule Creation Protocol**

### **After Each Complete Day:**
1. **Create Next Study Day Schedule:**
   - Generate `progress/[next_day]_schedule.md`
   - Include remaining tasks from current day
   - Plan next Meta exercise based on topic progression
   - Set realistic time allocations (2-3 hours total)

2. **Schedule Structure:**
   - Morning session (30-45 min): Complete remaining tasks + new concepts
   - Afternoon session (1-1.5 hours): Main learning + Meta exercise
   - Evening session (30 min): Review + planning

3. **Weekend Handling:**
   - Skip weekend days (Saturday/Sunday)
   - Create schedule for next Monday
   - Note weekend break in progress files

---

## 🔄 **Progress Update Workflow**

### **Step 1: Session Completion Check**
- Verify what was actually completed vs. planned
- Update time spent accurately
- Mark topics as completed (✅) or in progress (🔄)

### **Step 2: Reflection Questions**
- Add 3-4 reflection questions after each completed topic
- Questions should focus on learning process, challenges, and improvements
- Include technical concept understanding and problem-solving approach

### **Step 3: Meta Exercise Tracking**
- Update completion status in Meta Tech Screen Preparation section
- Note which topic area was covered
- Track progress: X/17 exercises completed

### **Step 4: Next Day Planning**
- Identify incomplete tasks from current day
- Plan next learning objectives
- Create focused, achievable daily schedule

---

## 📁 **File Management Rules**

### **Keep Only Essential Files:**
1. **`complete_timeline.md`** - 7-week overview with reflection questions
2. **`daily_study_schedule.md`** - General time management framework
3. **`week1_progress.md`** - Weekly detailed progress with daily logs
4. **`[day]_schedule.md`** - Current/next day specific plan

### **File Cleanup:**
- Remove completed daily schedules after 2 days
- Archive completed week files when moving to next week
- Keep only current week + next week schedule active

---

## 🎯 **Content Standards**

### **Progress Updates Must Include:**
- ✅/🔄 status for each topic
- Actual time spent (not estimated)
