# Study Progress Automation Rules

## 🎯 **Primary Purpose**
Automatically update progress tracking and create next-day schedules after each completed study session.

---

## 🧠 **TEACHING METHODOLOGY RULES**

### **🎓 Core Teaching Principles:**
1. **NEVER show complete solutions upfront** - Guide students to discover answers themselves
2. **Use Socratic method** - Ask leading questions that guide thinking
3. **Break problems into smaller steps** - Help students understand the problem-solving process
4. **Encourage independent thinking** - Let students work through challenges with guidance
5. **Provide hints, not answers** - Give clues that lead to the solution
6. **Celebrate progress** - Acknowledge each step forward, even small ones

### **🔍 Problem-Solving Teaching Flow:**
1. **Problem Understanding** - Help student break down what's being asked
2. **Strategy Discussion** - Guide them to think about approaches
3. **Step-by-Step Guidance** - Ask questions that lead to the next logical step
4. **Implementation Support** - Help with syntax/errors, not complete solutions
5. **Verification** - Guide them to test and validate their own work

### **❌ What NOT to Do:**
- Show complete working code without student input
- Solve problems for the student
- Jump straight to implementation
- Assume the student can't figure it out
- Give away the "aha moment"

### **✅ What TO Do:**
- Ask "What do you think would happen if...?"
- Guide with "How could you approach this?"
- Break down: "Let's think about this step by step"
- Encourage: "Try this approach and see what happens"
- Support: "What error are you getting? Let's debug together"

## ⚡ **QUICK REFERENCE - Copy & Paste These Commands:**

### **Progress Updates:**
```
@progress [topic] [time]        → Quick progress update
++ [topic] [time]               → Alternative quick command
```

### **Schedule Creation:**
```
@schedule [next_day]            → Create next day's schedule
## [next_day]                   → Alternative quick command
```

### **Meta Exercise Completion:**
```
@meta [exercise_name]           → Mark Meta exercise complete
!! [exercise_name]              → Alternative quick command
```

### **Day Completion:**
```
@day [day_number]               → Complete day, plan next
** [day_number]                 → Alternative quick command
```

### **Weekend Handling:**
```
@weekend                        → Create Monday schedule

---

## 📋 **Session Completion Protocol**

### **After Each Session (30+ minutes of study):**
1. **Update Progress Files:**
   - Mark completed topics with ✅ in `progress/week1_progress.md`
   - Update time spent and add session notes
   - Add reflection questions for completed topics
   - Update Meta exercise completion status

2. **Session Documentation:**
   - Record specific challenges faced and solutions
   - Note key learnings and breakthroughs
   - Document any debugging processes or errors resolved

---

## 📅 **Daily Schedule Creation Protocol**

### **After Each Complete Day:**
1. **Create Next Study Day Schedule:**
   - Generate `progress/[next_day]_schedule.md`
   - Include remaining tasks from current day
   - Plan next Meta exercise based on topic progression
   - Set realistic time allocations (2-3 hours total)

2. **Schedule Structure:**
   - Morning session (30-45 min): Complete remaining tasks + new concepts
   - Afternoon session (1-1.5 hours): Main learning + Meta exercise
   - Evening session (30 min): Review + planning

3. **Weekend Handling:**
   - Skip weekend days (Saturday/Sunday)
   - Create schedule for next Monday
   - Note weekend break in progress files

---

## 🔄 **Progress Update Workflow**

### **Step 1: Session Completion Check**
- Verify what was actually completed vs. planned
- Update time spent accurately
- Mark topics as completed (✅) or in progress (🔄)

### **Step 2: Reflection Questions**
- Add 3-4 reflection questions after each completed topic
- Questions should focus on learning process, challenges, and improvements
- Include technical concept understanding and problem-solving approach

### **Step 3: Meta Exercise Tracking**
- Update completion status in Meta Tech Screen Preparation section
- Note which topic area was covered
- Track progress: X/17 exercises completed

### **Step 4: Next Day Planning**
- Identify incomplete tasks from current day
- Plan next learning objectives
- Create focused, achievable daily schedule

---

## 📁 **File Management Rules**

### **Keep Only Essential Files:**
1. **`complete_timeline.md`** - 7-week overview with reflection questions
2. **`daily_study_schedule.md`** - General time management framework
3. **`week1_progress.md`** - Weekly detailed progress with daily logs
4. **`[day]_schedule.md`** - Current/next day specific plan

### **File Cleanup:**
- Remove completed daily schedules after 2 days
- Archive completed week files when moving to next week
- Keep only current week + next week schedule active

---

## 🎯 **Content Standards**

### **Progress Updates Must Include:**
- ✅/🔄 status for each topic
- Actual time spent (not estimated)
- Specific challenges and solutions
- Key learnings and insights
- Reflection questions for completed topics

### **Schedule Creation Must Include:**
- Clear session breakdown with time allocations
- Specific learning objectives for each session
- Meta exercise focus area
- Success criteria for the day
- Resources and preparation needed

---

## 🚀 **Automation Triggers**

### **When to Update Progress:**
- After any study session ≥30 minutes
- When completing a Meta exercise
- At the end of each study day
- Before creating next day's schedule

### **When to Create Schedule:**
- After completing a full day's work
- When transitioning to new topic areas
- Before weekend breaks (create Monday schedule)
- When mentor sessions are scheduled
