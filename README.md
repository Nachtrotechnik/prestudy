# IT Engineering Study Roadmap

## Overview
This repository contains your structured learning path for IT Engineering fundamentals, following a 7-week preparation plan.

## Study Phases

### Phase 1: Foundational Skills Blitz (Weeks 1-3)
- **Week 1**: Python Basics & Java OOP Refresh
- **Week 2**: Python Libraries & Advanced OOP  
- **Week 3**: Python OOP & Linux/Docker

### Phase 2: Deep Dive & Broadening Skills (Weeks 4-7)
- **Week 4**: Algorithms & Data Structures & GitLab Workflow
- **Week 5**: Mathematics & C/C++ Exposure
- **Week 6**: SQL/NoSQL & Final Review
- **Week 7**: Final Preparation

## Current Focus: Week 1 - Python Basics & Java OOP Refresh

### Learning Objectives:
- [ ] Review Python basics: syntax, data types, control flow
- [ ] Learn Python functions and data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- [ ] Complete 5-10 basic Python problems
- [ ] Refresh core Java OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods)
- [ ] Practice the four pillars of OOP

## Additional Learning Paths

### Meta Tech Screen Preparation
For those preparing for technical interviews at Meta or similar companies, we've included specialized exercises covering:
- **Core CS Fundamentals**: Algorithms, data structures, OOP design
- **Interview-Specific Skills**: Big O analysis, optimization, edge case handling
- **Meta-Specific Preparation**: Company values, technology stack familiarity

These exercises are designed to complement your weekly studies and can be practiced alongside your main curriculum.
